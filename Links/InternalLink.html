      <h2 id="internal">Internal Links</h2>
      <div>
        a (anchor) elements can also create internal links to jump to different
        sections within a webpage. To create an internal link, you assign a
        link's href attribute to a hash symbol # plus the value of the id
        attribute for the element that you want to link to, usually further down
        the page internally. You then need to add the same id attribute to the
        element you are linking to. An id is an attribute that uniquely
        identifies an element. Let us create an a tag and an h2 tag on our HTML
        page. Next, let us update the id attribute of the h2 same as the href
        attribute for the anchor tag.
